# Titanic-data-analysis
This repository contains all the files used to carry out the analysis of the Titanic data set.
\
The analysis focuses on the relationship between passengers that survived and their age, gender and social status.
\
I have carefully documented my findings in the PDF. Feel free to go through it.
\
I have also included the Python scripts used to carry out the analysis also I have made available the data set.
